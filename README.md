The intent of this exercise is to demonstrate understanding of clean code naming conventions and practices

Question:
1. Uncle Bob provides a lot of examples on what to avoid when it comes to naming. What qualities define a "meaningful name," and why is it important?

Answer:

A meaningful name should be contextually relevant to the code that surrounds and relates to it, as well as being quickly and easily understandable(little to no interpretation needed). This enables anyone reading the code to quickly understand what the name is meant to convey and how the named entity interacts with the program it is in.
